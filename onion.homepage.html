Those who are certified are recognized fairly for their skills as Ruby engineers and as having high levels of Ruby-based system development capabilities. Acquiring the certification makes it possible to appeal to others of the basic knowledge and application skills possessed that are necessary for Ruby-based system development. Those who pass the examination are certified by the Ruby Association as a Ruby Association Certified Ruby Programmer.

The given exam covers Ruby 1.8.x features and syntax.
